Unit Tests are listed below by team member.

Brian Ecker:
    All test files are prefaced with test_.*.py. They follow standard python unittest (the module) conventions, but
    many test classes use the Django TestCase class instead of the standard unittest.TestCase. This is because many
    tests involve the database or settings variables that are only available when using the Django app to run the tests.

    Use `manage.py test` to run the tests.

    Tested modules include:
        lazy_lecture_bot/modules/blob_storage
        lazy_lecture_bot/modules/video_processing
        lazy_lecture_bot/modules/voice_to_text
        lazy_lecture_bot/modules/voice_to_text/watson

    Equivalence classes are not used for testing because they modules primarily cover video processing, and generating
    videos as an equivalence class is highly non-trivial. Nevertheless, they only use one or two test videos (included
    in the repository), and this could likely be improved to have greater coverage.

    - Watson tests will fail if you do not have IBM credentials set up.
    - Blob storage tests will fail if you do not have s3 credentials set up.
