Working Prototype Known Problems Report -- LazyLectureBot -- AI/ML -- 06/03/16

    Bugs and Non-functional components:
        • mp4 or webm:
            ◦ mp4 only works for short videos because the video is treated as an arbitrary string of bytes, and mp4 has
              valuable meta-information at the end of the video.
            ◦ webm should work for longer videos
         • memory restrictions:
            ◦ Ensure your video is not larger than 50Mb (the largest tested size), and is in webm format if it is
              larger than 5Mb
            ◦ If multiple videos are being uploaded at once, the worker will try to work on a lot of them at once.
              This will cause us to blow up our memory limit (around 512Mb), and all the videos in the processing
              pipeline will be stuck. The pipeline will recover, and it will continue to process other videos, but the
              stuck videos will not be discarded or fixed. This could be accounted for by monitoring the total number
              of videos being processing at once, and the size of each video because each video needs to be loaded into
              memory completely.
         • uptime restrictions:
            ◦ Main site has full 24/7 uptime capability, but search functionality is limited to a max of 16 hours a
              day uptime
         • The Messages link at the top of the page does not do anything.
         • Uploading private videos is buggy and untested. It may be completely non-functional.
         • Mobile sized screens have some display issues:
            ◦ Home, subscriptions, etc. bar overlays some of the content at the top of the page when it stacks.
         • Favorites button on video watch page is buggy. It does not properly show favorited status, and the animation is buggy.
           The favoriting on the index page works correctly.
