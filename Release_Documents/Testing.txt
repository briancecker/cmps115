System Tests:
    NOTE: In all scenarios, it is assumed that the LazyLectureBot app is running, and the associated ElasticSearch
          search server is also running.

    1. Addressed user stories:
        "As a user, I would like a web interface that allows me to log in..."

            - Confirm Password: llblovesbluecats
            - Click "Sign Up" at the bottom of the form
        - You should be redirected to the home page.
        - Ensure that the button in the top right which formerly said "Log In" now says "llb"

    2. DEPENDS ON (1) Addresses user stories:
        "As a user, I would like to retrieve a text transcript of a video's content because it will allow
        me to scan the video with ease."
        "As a user, I would like my video to process asynchronously, so that I can close the page after the upload is
        done and come back later."
        "As a user, I would like more UI feedback when things like uploading are happening, so that I can tell how the
        progress is going"
        - Click UPLOAD and type:
            - Title: Test
            - Description: Short test video
            - Privacy Settings: Public
            - Video: Upload lazy_lecture_bot/resources/test_videos/30_sec_cpp_example.mp4
            - When upload bar finishes, click the UPLOAD button at the bottom of the page.
        - Click the video with name "Test"
            - Wait until the status updates complete.
            - Check that status updates display changing statuses including some about transcribing segments
            - Transcript will appear where status updates previously displayed.

    3. DEPENDS ON (2). Addresses user stories:
        "As a user, I would like to search for videos that may be relevant to my current class, so that I can find
        other perspectives from other instructors."
        - In the main search bar where it says "What are you looking for?" type:
            - "Short test"
            - Click "Search"
        - The video with name "Test" should appear

    4. DEPENDS ON (2). Addresses user stories:
        "As a user, I would like to click text search results to seek to the corresponding video location."
        "As a user, I would like to search within a video's transcript for relevant sections because it will make
        finding content I am looking for within a video easier."
        - Click the video with name "Test"
        - In the search box that says "Type to Filter Utterances", type "dialog box"
        - There should only be one utterance displayed, and it should include the text "dialog box"
        - Click this utterance.
        - You should go to the location in the video that corresponds to this utterance.


Unit Tests are listed below by team member.

    Brian Ecker:
        All test files are prefaced with test_.*.py. They follow standard python unittest (the module) conventions, but
        many test classes use the Django TestCase class instead of the standard unittest.TestCase. This is because many
        tests involve the database or settings variables that are only available when using the Django app to run the tests.

        Use `manage.py test` to run the tests.

        Tested modules include:
            lazy_lecture_bot/modules/blob_storage
            lazy_lecture_bot/modules/video_processing
            lazy_lecture_bot/modules/voice_to_text
            lazy_lecture_bot/modules/voice_to_text/watson

        Equivalence classes are not used for testing because they modules primarily cover video processing, and generating
        videos as an equivalence class is highly non-trivial. Nevertheless, they only use one or two test videos (included
        in the repository), and this could likely be improved to have greater coverage.

        - Watson tests will fail if you do not have IBM credentials set up.
        - Blob storage tests will fail if you do not have s3 credentials set up.
